# Smart AI-Powered Recipe Generator

The Smart AI-Powered Recipe Generator is an app where you input available ingredients, and AI generates recipes instantly. It solves the problem where people donâ€™t know what to cook with the ingredients they have. Features include suggested recipes based on available ingredients as well as custom filters (low-calorie, high-protein, vegan, keto, etc). Future development may lead to monetization opportunities in the form of subscription-based enabled features in which users may generate grocery lists based on missing ingredients or one-click online grocery orders via Instacart/Amazon.
