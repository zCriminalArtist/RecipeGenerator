# Smart AI-Powered Recipe Generator

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zCriminalArtist/RecipeGenerator/main/frontend/mobile/assets/images/icon.png" width="200" height="200" align="right">

IngrediGo is the smart AI-Powered Recipe Generator app where you input available ingredients, and AI generates recipes instantly. It solves the problem where people don‚Äôt know what to cook with the ingredients they have. Features include suggested recipes based on available ingredients as well as custom filters (low-calorie, high-protein, vegan, keto, etc). Future development may lead to monetization opportunities in the form of subscription-based enabled features in which users may generate grocery lists based on missing ingredients or one-click online grocery orders via Instacart/Amazon.
