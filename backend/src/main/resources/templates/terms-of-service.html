    <p><b>13. TERM AND TERMINATION</b></p>
    <p>These Legal Terms shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION AND WITHOUT NOTICE OR LIABILITY, DENY ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES (INCLUDING BLOCKING CERTAIN IP ADDRESSES), TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY REASON OR FOR NO REASON.

    <p><b>15. GOVERNING LAW</b></p>
    <p>These Legal Terms and your use of the Services are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>

    <p><b>16. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</b></p>
    <p><b>Informal Negotiations</b></p>
    <p>The Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other.</p>

    <p><b>Binding Arbitration</b></p>
    <p>If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be under the Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online, and will take place in Miami-Dade, Florida.</p>
    <p>If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced in the state or federal courts located in Florida. The Parties hereby consent to and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction in such courts. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

    <p><b>Restrictions</b></p>
    <p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. There is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or on behalf of others.</p>

    <p><b>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</b></p>
    <p>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect intellectual property rights; (b) any Dispute related to or arising from allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then the Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>

    <p><b>17. CORRECTIONS</b></p>
    <p>There may be information on the Services that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions and to change or update the information on the Services at any time, without prior notice.</p>

    <p><b>18. DISCLAIMER</b></p>

    <p><b>19. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY</b></p>
    <p>IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFIT OR OTHER DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU TO US DURING THE SIX (6) MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING.</p>

    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless, including our subsidiaries, affiliates, and all of our respective officers, agents, partners, and employees, from and against any loss, damage, liability, claim, or demand made by any third party due to or arising out of: (1) your use of the Services; (2) breach of these Legal Terms; or (3) your violation of the rights of a third party. We reserve the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us.</p>

    <p><b>21. USER DATA</b></p>
    <p>We will maintain certain data that you transmit to the Services for the purpose of managing performance, as well as data relating to your use of the Services. However, you are solely responsible for all data that you transmit. You agree that we shall have no liability to you for any loss or corruption of such data.</p>

    <p><b>24. MISCELLANEOUS</b></p>
    <p>These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Services constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision shall not operate as a waiver. These Legal Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign all of our rights and obligations to others at any time. If any provision of these Legal Terms is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision is deemed severable and does not affect validity of remaining provisions.</p>
